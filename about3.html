        who have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>

      <h3>General Info</h3>
      <p>
        The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
        athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to
        learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the
        ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is run
        by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time
        of parents and former league members.
